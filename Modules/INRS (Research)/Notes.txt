1. Positivist/positivism (1 statement to 1 resolution relation) - tells us what is percieved as correct (mostly reliant on statistics, predictions and correlations). Has 3 components (Observation, Prediction, Conclusion)

example : If I drink 500ml of water (observation state) then my thirst will be quenched (prediction) due to my body needs (conclusion).

Interperetivist (one statement to many posabilities) - tells us why or perspectives of sources of a specific topic.

example : If I drive 60KM I might have go into an accident.

Critical Realism : combination of both positivism and interpretivism to bring a real change that is direct.
