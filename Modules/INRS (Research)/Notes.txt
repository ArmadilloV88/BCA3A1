use only the 3 paradigm's prescribed in the text book

use formal language in your research

all research elements must allign

make sure your research is on the correct format

use your textbook

use your skills gained from the research book

define your study description as precise as possible 

Golden rule of researching :

1. Know your paradigms
2. Identify your paradigm or the paradigm used
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Why research :
-Identify problems
-find answers and/or solutions
-make suggestions to prevent undesired consequences
-challenge stereotypes
-generate awarness

first 4 steps of research :
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1. Identify and analyse the problem
2. Reading about topics (books and articles) and writing a literature review
3. Formulating your RQ and/ or Ha
4. Choose a research approach/design
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Quantitative = presenting numerical data (number of times)
Qualitative = presenting interpretative data (why or how)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(Page 42)
1. Positivist/positivism (1 statement to 1 resolution relation) - tells us what is percieved as correct (mostly reliant on statistics, predictions and correlations). Has 3 components (Observation, Prediction, Conclusion)

example : If I drink 500ml of water (observation state) then my thirst will be quenched (prediction) due to my body needs (conclusion).

Interperetivist (one statement to many posabilities) - tells us why or perspectives of sources of a specific topic.

example : If I drive 60KM I might have go into an accident.

Critical Realism : combination of both positivism and interpretivism to bring a real change that is direct.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
paradigm shift - is the chance of mind of one aspect to another (example religious to athiest or smoking to non smoking)

Research traditions :
1.Epistemological - knowledge
2.Ontological - reality (reason how or why)
3.Metatheoretical - theory
4.Methodological - research methods
5.Anxiological - value
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Theories for positivist studies = aims to find theories that make predicitions or that speak to the relationship between A and B

Theories for Interpretivist studies = aim to find theories that explain why or how A effects B

provide a full discussion of your theory (atleast a Page)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
What Makes a good theory :

1 - Theoretical Scope - how broadly it can explain a phenomenon where you start with an assumption that can be supported by an applicable theory, ensure to provide context. 

2 - Appropriateness - Does your theory allign with your problem statement. Internal consistency which is to aim for the relationship between variables. External consistency whish is where the elements are applied appropriately.

3 - Heurisitc value
4 - Validity
5 - Parsimony
6 - Openness
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
structure 

1 - problem statement - establishes the problem statement; states what is the issue immediately
2 - Research question 
2 - Theory statement - establishes the theoretical studies
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
types of theory

1- Deductive (mostly positivism) starts will reading books/articles/sources then you make a proof
2- Inductive (Mostly Interpretivism) starts with the proof then leading to finding supporting books/articles/sources
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Problem statement breakdown :

Paragraph 1 - looking at your statement compared to available resources (how relevant/big is the issue). What is the ideal situation versus what is the real situation. (international issue)

Goal 1 - What is the international rellevance of the issue.
Goal 2 - What is the result you wish to find out

Paragraph 2 - How real is the problem in South Africa specifically (local issue) 

Paragraph 3 - What is the aim of the research study to acomplish (25 - 30 words)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Types of research page 91-92

Pure/Basic research (Positivism or interpretism) - aims to provide only answers and add to the exisiting knowledge using valid and reliable surveys

Applied research (critical change) - aims to apply knowledge to real situations

Exploratory Research
Descriptive Research
Correlational Research
Applied Research
Explanatory Research
Predictive Research
Pragmatic Research
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Hypothesis
-a statement you aim to accept or reject / a statement to assist in your research and to predict an outcome (If A then B)
-its not the truth yet
-a statement that has to be tested to find out if its true

use 'if' and 'then'

before writiing the HA(Hypothesis) make sure to understand your problem statement
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Types of Hypothesis
-Alternative Hypothesis - predicts an expected outcome where the aim is to show there is a relationship
-Null Hypothesis - makes a predicition that no relationship exists between A and B
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Variables page 99 Table 6.2

Dependent Variable = B is affected by A (B depends on the effect of A)
Independent Variable = A is not effect by B 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Literature review process:

1.Identify and identify key terms
2.Determine relationships
3.Establish a framework
4.Determine information gaps

establish objectives which establish literacy sections

Types of reviews :

1. Historical reviews (phases of development)
2. Thematic reviews (different perspectives)
3. Theoretical reviews
4. Empirical reviews

primary sources - includes gathering data through research instruments i.e. interviews

secondary sources - books, articles, journals

when taking an article :

Who is writing the article and their accreditation ? (what say do thay have in the industry)
What is being written on the source and its rellevance ? (it must allign to your topic)
Where is the research done and its rellevance ? (must be in africa)
When is the source written ? (10 year difference)

1st level numbering : 1.INTRODUCTION (Must be in caps)
2nd level numbering : 1.i.Backyard (proper case)
3rd level numbering : 1.ii.Frontyard (proper case)

Concept - an abstract idea that we give meaning to by defining it.
