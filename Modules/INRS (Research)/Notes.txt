use only the 3 paradigm's prescribed in the text book

use formal language in your research

all research elements must allign

make sure your research is on the correct format

use your textbook

use your skills gained from the research book

define your study description as precise as possible 

Golden rule of researching :

1. Know your paradigms
2. Identify your paradigm or the paradigm used
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Why research :
-Identify problems
-find answers and/or solutions
-make suggestions to prevent undesired consequences
-challenge stereotypes
-generate awarness

first 4 steps of research :
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1. Identify and analyse the problem
2. Reading about topics (books and articles) and writing a literature review
3. Formulating your RQ and/ or Ha
4. Choose a research approach/design
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Quantitative = presenting numerical data (number of times)
Qualitative = presenting interpretative data (why or how)

(Page 42)
1. Positivist/positivism (1 statement to 1 resolution relation) - tells us what is percieved as correct (mostly reliant on statistics, predictions and correlations). Has 3 components (Observation, Prediction, Conclusion)

example : If I drink 500ml of water (observation state) then my thirst will be quenched (prediction) due to my body needs (conclusion).

Interperetivist (one statement to many posabilities) - tells us why or perspectives of sources of a specific topic.

example : If I drive 60KM I might have go into an accident.

Critical Realism : combination of both positivism and interpretivism to bring a real change that is direct.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
paradigm shift - is the chance of mind of one aspect to another (example religious to athiest or smoking to non smoking)

Research traditions :
1.Epistemological - knowledge
2.Ontological - reality (reason how or why)
3.Metatheoretical - theory
4.Methodological - research methods
5.Anxiological - value
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Theories for positivist studies = aims to find theories that make predicitions or that speak to the relationship between A and B

Theories for Interpretivist studies = aim to find theories that explain why or how A effects B

provide a full discussion of your theory (atleast a Page)

What Makes a good theory :

1 - Theoretical Scope - how broadly it can explain a phenomenon where you start with an assumption that can be supported by an applicable theory, ensure to provide context. 

2 - Appropriateness - Does your theory allign with your problem statement. Internal consistency which is to aim for the relationship between variables. External consistency whish is where the elements are applied appropriately.

3 - Heurisitc value
4 - Validity
5 - Parsimony
6 - Openness
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
structure 

1 - problem statement - establishes the problem statement; states what is the issue immediately
2 - Research question 
2 - Theory statement - establishes the theoretical studies
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
types of theory

1- Deductive (mostly positivism) starts will reading books/articles/sources then you make a proof
2- Inductive (Mostly Interpretivism) starts with the proof then leading to finding supporting books/articles/sources
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Problem statement breakdown :

Paragraph 1 - looking at your statement compared to available resources (how relevant/big is the issue). What is the ideal situation versus what is the real situation. (international issue)

Goal 1 - What is the international rellevance of the issue.
Goal 2 - What is the result you wish to find out

Paragraph 2 - How real is the problem in South Africa specifically (local issue) 

Paragraph 3 - What is the aim of the research study to acomplish (25 - 30 words)
