Article 1 is interpritism. 

example 1 : " what
are South African postgraduate students’ knowledge and
experiences"

example 2 : "This was a qualitative exploratory 
study to investigate postgraduate students’ experience with 
research ethics"

examplee 3 : "Researchers using interpretive methods study 
social reality by applying an open-ended approach to data
collection and a flexible research design (Usher, 2020)."

How was the target population acquired : "A Twitter account
(@pgResearchEthics) was created specifically to recruit participants. 
A pamphlet detailing the project and contact information was posted on 
Twitter account’s feed and stories. Hashtags relating to postgraduate studies 
and research ethics were used to increase the reach of the target population. 
Additionally, the researchers also posted the pamphlet on their personal accounts."

Filtering : "To participate in the study the participants had to be 20 years of age 
and older and graduated with a Masters or Doctoral degree from a South African university 
or university of technology from 2018 to 2021. The participants studied a range of disciplines
as indicated in Table 1. Hennink and Kaiser (2022) confirmed that qualitative studies can reach 
saturation at relatively small sample sizes of 9–17 interviews.", "Students who graduated between 
2018 and 2021 were a targeted sample since they had recent research ethics exposure to reflect on 
and could provide rich data related to the study’s research aim.", "The participants were from eight 
different institutions in five provinces. Eight participants were masters graduates and four were 
doctoral graduates."

Population : " Twelve participants were included in the study as saturation was reached."

Ethics : "Ethics approval was received to conduct the study. All
participants signed an informed consent form before participating in the interviews. They were also informed of the
voluntariness of their participation and confidentiality of
the information provided. The names of the universities
have not been provided for confidentiality reasons. The
interview guide explored the students’ experiences with
research ethics. Pseudonyms were allocated to each of the
participants. The researcher sought to increase validity and
trustworthiness (Higson-Smith et al., 2000) by using
member checking, which affords participants the opportunity to review their statements for accuracy (Dudovskiy,
2016). Participants were also given the option to go
through their transcripts and coding to clarify any misrepresentations."
